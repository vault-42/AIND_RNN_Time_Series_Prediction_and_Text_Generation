# AIND_RNN_Time_Series_Prediction_and_Text_Generation
Generate new text sentences using a LSTM RNN model trained from Sherlock Holmes novels

## Getting Started
### Hardware Requirements
It is highly recommended to run this project on a computer or cloud instance with a high-end Nvidia GPU (GTX 1070 or higher). Running this program on a CPU only computer will take a prohibitively long time.

### Software Requirements
This program requires Python 3.5 and the libraries indicated in the `requirements.txt` file. Use pip to download the required libraries by running

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Run the Code
To run the code open the Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions.

`jupyter notebook RNN_project.ipynb`
